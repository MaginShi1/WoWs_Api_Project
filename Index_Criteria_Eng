1 -  Get clan API from https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/all/wot/account/list/#response_block
2 -  Obtain the player API from there and look up each player's data

Data for each ship type:
  - Battles
  - Win rate
  - Avg frags
  - Avg dmg
  - Avg plane destroyed
  - Max frags
  - Max dmg
  - Max plane destroyed

Criteria for the index:

Calculating an index for each ship type separately, but only after 10 games per ship type


On the selected ship type use the normal formula to rate it from 0 to 10 maybe keeping in consideration the games played up to 150 https://wows-numbers.com/personal/rating
  rDmg = actualDmg/expectedDmg
  rWins = actualWins/expectedWins
  rFrags = actualFrags/expectedFrags
  nDmg = max(0, (rDmg - 0.4) / (1 - 0.4))
  nFrags = max(0, (rFrags - 0.1) / (1 - 0.1))
  nWins = max(0, (rWins - 0.7) / (1 - 0.7))
  PR =  700*nDMG + 300*nFrags + 150*nWins //TO FIX LATER WITH DATA TO MKAE IT GIVE A NUMBER 0 TO 10
  Also, this number should be divided by 100 and multiplied by Val = (72) at 10 wins, Val is increased by 0.2 for every win, up to 100 once it reaches 150

Player Index should be the avg accounting for games played (for example if 50% of the games were spent with a destroyer it will be kept in consideration)
